Pho is the staple of Vietnamese cuisine. Everyone loves pho, and I'm not being biased. No one can resist the signature balance of protein, fiber and carbs in a bowl of pho, the heart-warming umami rich beef broth, the perfect blend of aromatic herbs (consisting of star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove) and the kaleidoscope of texture & color. Almost every city in the US I travel to, there is at least a pho restaurant (whether they are authentic is another story for another day). If you have never had pho, try it out! If you want to take your love for pho to the next level and are interested in making it by yourself, there are a copious number of recipes on the Internet that give you detailed instructions. I'm here to give you some fun facts about pho that it is very likely that you did not know about.
1. There are quite a few variations of pho in Vietnam, e.g pho Sai Gon, pho Ha Noi, pho Nam Dinh, etc. The vast majority of pho served in the US is pho Sai Gon (originated from Sai Gon, the South of Vietnam). Pho Ha Noi is a far cry from pho Sai Gon, with respect to their flavor profiles. Which pho is better? This is a debate that can never reach to an unanimous agreement and perhaps is one of the non-polical questions that could easily divide the nation. Sai Gon people take pride in their rich flavorful broth, Ha Noi people would not change a thing in their subtle broth. Sai Gon people firmly believe hoisin sauce and sriracha are the combo condiments that go hand-in-hand with pho and elevate pho flavor. Ha Noi people find it outrageous and offensive if pho is served with any condiments but homemade chili garlic fish sauce.

2. There is no proper way to eat pho. Using forks instead of chopsticks won't get you frowned upon. You could add condiments directly into your bowl or put them on a saucer to dip meat in for all I care. 
3. For how fantastic pho is, a great portion of Vietnamese, including me, do not think pho is the best Vietnamese noodle dish. Next time you are in a Vietnamese restaurant, be more adventurous and order something other than pho, you will have your mind blown.

I'm currently an Assistant Professor in Statistics at Department of Mathematics, Winston-Salem State University (WSSU). Prior to my appointment at WSSU, I pursued a Ph.D degree in Statistics at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, under [Dr. Kalimuthu Krishnoorthy](https://math.louisiana.edu/node/123)'s supervision. My main research interests lie at the intersection between small sample interference discrete/continuous distributions and developing hypothesis tests as well as statistical intervals employing [Fiducial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14598.pdf) techniques. My research so far reflects these interests.

As an educator in Statistics, my dual objectives are to dispel the myth that Statistics is an insurmountable fortress and to cultivate an environment where learning is an active, collaborative endeavor. I, however, do not see research and teaching as two separate tasks; rather, they are intertwined facets of a broader learning process. I do research to be a better teacher and teaching inspires my research.

After work, I enjoy simple underated pleasures in life, e.g. running, a lazy afternoon with my husband and our dog, a long walk in the woods, reading [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40495148) which I never had a chance to finish, gardening, watching [King of the Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill), etc.
